## Project Overview
Managing short-term contacts can be time-consuming and cumbersome. Adding temporary contacts—such as those for military duty or temporary work—to your main contact list can clutter it with people you no longer need.  

This Android application solves this problem by allowing users to manage groups of contacts for short-term or long-term purposes. Once the interaction ends, users can easily remove individual contacts or entire lists without affecting other contacts.  

The app also makes communication effortless: with a single click, users can contact anyone via phone call, email, or direct WhatsApp message.  

Designed for both young and mature audiences, this app offers a convenient, professional, and enjoyable way to organize contacts and communicate quickly.
